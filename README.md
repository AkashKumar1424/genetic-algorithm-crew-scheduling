Parallel Genetic Algorithm for Airline Crew Scheduling

Genetic Algorithm for Airline Crew Scheduling
Prescriptive Analytics Project — Masters of Data Analytics

This project builds a Parallel Genetic Algorithm (GA)–based solver for optimizing airline crew schedules. Crew scheduling is one of the most complex and expensive operational challenges in aviation. Our solution combines meta-heuristics + multi-threading to generate near-optimal pairings faster than traditional solvers.

🔍 Project Overview

Airline crew costs are the second largest operational expense, and traditional solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi become slow as the number of flights increases.

We implemented a Parallel GA Framework inspired by Ouyang & Zhu (2023) to:

1. Improve runtime efficiency.

2. Increase crew–flight matching.

3. Enhance scalability in large datasets.
